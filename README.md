# Pewlett Hackard

## Overview of Analysis
This project highlighted a very real problem companies face with the quantity of "baby boomer" generational employees retiring from the workforce around the same time when they are reaching age 67-70.  This massive retirement must be planned for to ensure the company operation doesn't suffer from the loss of knowledge and skills.  Pewlett Hackard is getting ahead of this issue by investing in reviewing a mentorship program for key jobs and departments.  One facet of this planning was to determine which departments will be suffering the losses of employees with upcomming retirements.  Not surprisingly some of the Senior positions have the greatest number, about 26,000 Senior Engineers, and about 25,000 Senior Staff memebers.  The second aspect would be seeing if there are enough employees in these vital job roles that can be mentor employees to re-fill these positions once others retire.
